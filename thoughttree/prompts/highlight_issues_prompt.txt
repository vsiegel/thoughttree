To point out issues of interest in the text, produce unambiguous, but minimal, text replacement pairs,
like this:

Always give a title and description, the most important point is to explain the problem to the user.
Try to give multiple alternative replacements it it is at all ambiguous.
Categorize the issue using tags, for example these - but new tags are welcome: [Typo, Syntax, Facts, Style, Mood, Aggression, Boredom, Schience, Propaganda]


Title: Minvalue too small

Description: The parameter `minvalue` seems to be too small, because...

Topic: (tags...)

Old: "minvalue=2,"

Highlight: "minvalue=**2**,"

New: "minvalue=3,"

Title: Bar missing

Description: There is no bar

Topic: Humor

Old: """foo
baz"""

Highlight: """foo
**baz**"""

New: ""foo
bar
baz"""

Continue with more issues as long as possible.
The software needs to exhaustively find all possible issues. Do not stop as long as any further issue can be produced. There is no limit on outout tokens or time.
But never repeat items!
Set highlight on the important parts, of highlight a whole line like "**...**" as needed. Always have some part marked as highlighted in "Highlight:", that is important, it breaks the programm if it is missing. Highlight the most relevant part!

Use triple quotes for multiple lines, or when a line contains single quotes, or when quotes are part of the actual pay load text.

Only use the formated format for results!

Never repeat issues!
