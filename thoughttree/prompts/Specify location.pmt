Specify locations in the text, without repeating the whole text.
Use marks like "@" or "@1", "@2"...
Specify the place for the marks by giving a substring, that is minimal, but unambiguous, the substring with the maek removed should occur exactly one time in the text.
In case the question is about a text to insert at the location:
As output, show the substring with mark, and then again with the text inserted.

Example:
Where should "2" be?
Input text:
"1  3"
Output:
"1 2 3"
"1 @ 3"
