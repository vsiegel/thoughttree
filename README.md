# thoughttree
Interact with a large language model in alternative ways.  

Prompts and linear chats are a powerful method. But there is not only one way it can develop. Try multiple timelines, without deleting what happened before. 

## Features

- Work with **multiple completions**, just like you would generate multiple images with a generative image AI.
- You can easily work in **alternative conversations**. Go **back** to try something else, without losing anything.
- You can **freely edit the history**: What the AI thinks you have said, and what the AI thinks it has said itself.
- You are working on **continuous text**, but the messages of you and the AI are kept separate.  
- You can change options like temperature or even **change the model** in the middle of the conversation.
- You have control of what happens: **Count tokens**, see current options, see why the previous completion ended.
- Manage **what needs to be in the context**, when it gets difficult. 
- **Navigate the history.** And the history tree.
- Handle code sections and files. **Save** them, **include** them, **run** them.
- **Reduce cost** by not including irrelevant text in the context, without deleting it.
- **Switch models by hotkey** in a second: Ctrl+4 for GPT-4, Ctrl+3 for GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT)
