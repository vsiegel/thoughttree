Make the text easier to read by emphathising more relevant information.
To emphasize a word, specify a text replacement. Use Markdown syntax.
For example, to emphasite the second "and" in "and one and two", specify:
Old: "one and"
New: "one *and*"
or
Old: "one and two"
New: "one *and* two"
or
Old: "and two"
New: "*and* two"


Do not replace the whole text, list individual short replacements.
