# thoughttree
Interact with large language models in alternative ways.

Prompts and linear chats are a powerful method. But there is not only one way it can develop. Work in multiple timelines, without deleting what happened before. 

A conversation with **GPT-4** or **ChatGPT** can be linear, so that each line produced depends on everything that was input or output before. That happens - in scientific experiments, but much less often in real life use. If it is not linear, that means there are parts in the context of a completion that are not needed. The model spends just the same attention, it may distort your results. You pay for these tokens. And chances are that you even pay more for them than for the tokens you actually use. That is hard to avoid, with complex manual cut and paste work, or often even impossible. thoughttree solves this problem by providing the right tools. And a lot more.

## Features

- Work with **multiple completions**, just like you would generate multiple images with a generative image AI.
- You can easily work in **alternative conversations**. Go **back** to try something else, without losing anything.
- You can **freely edit the history**: What the AI thinks you have said, and what the AI thinks it has said itself.
- You are working on **continuous text**, but the messages of you and the AI are kept separate.  
- You can change options like temperature or even **change the model** in the middle of the conversation.
- You have control of what happens: **Count tokens**, see current options, see why the previous completion ended.
- Manage **what needs to be in the context**, when it gets difficult. 
- **Navigate the history.** And the history tree.
- Handle code sections and files. **Save** them, **include** them, **run** them.
- **Reduce cost** by not including irrelevant text in the context, without deleting it.
- **Switch models by hotkey** in a second: Ctrl+4 for GPT-4, Ctrl+3 for GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT)
- Keep topics separate: If you have query on a new topic, the **history does not help**: It may hinder, and it causes costs.
