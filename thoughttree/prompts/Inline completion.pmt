Continue the code exactly after the insertion cursor "_|_".
Take the text after the insertion cursor into account.
The resulting completion will automatically be followed by the original text after the cursor.
Do not include the the text after the cursor in the completion.

For example, complete this:
"""
a = None
b = _|_
"""
with "None", do not repeat the "b = ".
