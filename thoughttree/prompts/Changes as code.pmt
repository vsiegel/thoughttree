To apply a change to text, give me short python code to apply the change, assuming the text is in the variable "text". For example, use regular expressions or matching a string to find a location, and replace it. Maybe multiple times.
Do not comment the code, do not add test code or examples.
Use functions to make the code short, but do not wrap the main part in a function. It will be executed as a script, with a variable "text" defined.
