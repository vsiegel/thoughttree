Give me a completion.
Start the completions with a space (" "),  except it is continuing a partial word.
i.e. after "foo", continue with " bar" instead of "bar"
If there is an empty or no user message after a completion, continue.
When continuing a completion, pay attention to insert a new line if necessary.

After that, give me many alternative completions that use different approaches.
Give me as many completions as possible.
Separated by "---" on a separate line.
Continue without stopping, up to the token limit.
Do not stop as long as there are other variants that can be explored.
Be creative, if the variants are similar, try something different.
The program fails if you stop early.
Do not repeat the existing code.
## Example input:
     def generate_title(self, event=None):
        focussed = self.focus_get()
        if not str(focussed).startswith(str(self)):
