If here is a line starting with a number and describing a task to do with the document, do that.
Otherwise: List things that you could do with the document as a language model, starting with the most useful in a typical office job. End the list with "
(end)"
Do not continue the list if the cursor (here) is already on a list item.

First print the current list item number.
