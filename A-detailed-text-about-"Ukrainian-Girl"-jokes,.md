Appendix B: 

Historic and cultural background of Ukrainian humor in general

Ukrainian humor has a long and rich history, dating back to the times of Kyivan Rus, a medieval state that existed from the 9th to the 13th century. The humor of this period was characterized by folk tales, anecdotes, and proverbs that often contained elements of satire, irony, and wordplay. These stories were passed down through generations and served as a means of entertainment and education.

Throughout history, Ukrainian humor has evolved and adapted to the changing social, political, and cultural contexts. During the Soviet era, humor became a tool for expressing dissent and critiquing the government, often through the use of satire and allegory. This period also saw the rise of the "anekdot," a short, humorous story that often contained a punchline or a twist.

In contemporary Ukraine, humor continues to play a significant role in society, with comedians, satirists, and humorists addressing various aspects of Ukrainian life, including politics, culture, and everyday experiences. Ukrainian humor often reflects the country's unique history, traditions, and values, while also serving as a means of coping with and commenting on current events and challenges.




Appendix C: 

Historic and cultural background of "Ukrainian girl"-jokes

The "Ukrainian girl" jokes have their roots in the broader context of Ukrainian humor, which has evolved over time to reflect the country's unique history, traditions, and values. These jokes specifically focus on the stereotypes and misconceptions surrounding Ukrainian women, often highlighting aspects of their culture, language, and traditions.

Historically, Ukrainian women have played a significant role in the country's cultural and social life. They have been known for their strong family values, dedication to their traditions, and resilience in the face of adversity. These qualities have contributed to the development of certain stereotypes and misconceptions about Ukrainian women, which have been incorporated into the "Ukrainian girl" jokes.

The cultural background of these jokes can be traced back to the traditional roles and expectations placed on Ukrainian women in society. For example, Ukrainian women have been traditionally responsible for maintaining the household, raising children, and preserving their cultural heritage. This has led to the development of jokes related to cooking, family life, and cultural practices.

In addition, the complex history of Ukraine, including its relationship with neighboring countries such as Russia, has also influenced the content of "Ukrainian girl" jokes. For instance, jokes related to language and national identity often reflect the historical tensions and political dynamics between Ukraine and Russia.

In contemporary Ukraine, "Ukrainian girl" jokes continue to be a popular form of humor, often used as a light-hearted way to explore and challenge cultural stereotypes and misconceptions. These jokes can serve as a starting point for conversations about cultural differences and understanding, fostering a greater appreciation for the unique aspects of Ukrainian culture and the experiences of Ukrainian women.

It is important to remember that these jokes are based on stereotypes and should not be taken as a representation of all Ukrainian women. People from all cultures have varying interests, preferences, and characteristics, and it is unfair to generalize an entire group based on a few jokes. Instead, "Ukrainian girl" jokes can be used as a tool for promoting cultural understanding and appreciation.
