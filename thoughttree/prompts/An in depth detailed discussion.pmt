An in depth detailed discussion of a general text,
based on an analysis of what is relevant in the context of the text.
For each individual input text or document, a method to analyse a document - optimized for the specific input with no need to be generalizable.
The methods used may vary widely for different input.
The method is represented in the structure of a decimal outline, with or without section texts.
The method set up in the first step is then applied to the input text/document.
In th second step, a decimal outline is used, independent of the first.
Both parts are very detailed and are not limited by conservative use of tokens.
